                <h3>Founding</h3>
                <p>The town of Stars Hollow was founded in 1779, but there are conflicting legends regarding how it got its name.
                    The traditionally accepted story involves two star-crossed lovers who seemed destined never to be together,
                    until separate cosmological phenomena involving stars led them to each other at the spot where the town now exists.
                    This is celebrated annually at the Firelight Festival.<br><br>
                    Another story of Stars Hollow's founding was a talking display built in the new Stars Hollow Museum explained
                    that a Puritan family first discovered the area while looking for a place to settle. The town therefore gained
                    its name from their observation of "the stars, so bright; this forest, so hollow!"</p>

            <div class="history-col">
                <h3>The Revolutionary War</h3>
                <p>During the American Revolutionary War, a "battle" was fought in Stars Hollow involving 12 men who stood and waited
                    for a group of incoming Redcoats who never arrived.<br><br>
                    A statue of Casimir Pulaski, Polish nobleman, soldier, and military commander who has been called, together with
                    his counterpart Michael Kovats de Fabriczy, "the father of the American cavalry," sits across from the town square.<br><br>
                    The bell at Stars Hollow was cast in 1780 to celebrate the first anniversary of the town. The bell cracked the first
                    time it was rung and weighed 2080 pounds. The strike of the bell is E-flat. On 6 June 1944 when Allied forces landed
                    in France, the sound of the bell was broadcast to all parts of the country.</p>
